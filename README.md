# hello-world
first github
hi all,

this is my first git hub.

My journey into computing began in 1984, when a commadore PET computer was introduced to the school.
Naturally I was not allowed to participate in the new computer science subject, as I was not in the top tiers of the school class system. 
Nether the less I attended the computer club after school and went on to study A level computer science at college, HND in Computer Science and later a BSc in Computer Science.
When one asks what was my first film i watched in a cinema, my answer is " My second film was TRON", as Bambi wasnt my choice. 
Even now, TRON has influences, my transcoding computers login is Flynn, my NAS is called MCP. I have always wanted to be flynn and pilot a spaceship similar to flight of the navigator. though to be honest Id rather have angelina jolie, gwyneth paltrow or keira knightley than Paul Reubens as my navigator.
Through the decades i have seen my dream computer programming setup in worgames, my perfect interview in swordfish and my killer app in trading places.
Did i work in computers, very sadly no; life was not that kind. Though, in later life, i have observed teams of programmers on multiple floors, squished in tiny cubicles (code monkeys as opposed to grease monkeys).
Anyway, I digress, here is my first github
